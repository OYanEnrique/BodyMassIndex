# üèãÔ∏è Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

This is a straightforward command-line tool written in Python to calculate a person's Body Mass Index (BMI). The user provides their weight in kilograms and height in meters, and the script calculates their BMI, classifying it into one of four categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `BMI.py`).
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the script:
    ```sh
    python BMI.py
    ```
5.  Enter your weight (in kg) and height (in meters) when prompted. The program will immediately display your calculated BMI and its corresponding category.

## BMI Categories

The classification is based on the following BMI ranges:
* **Underweight:** <= 18.5
* **Normal weight:** 18.5 ‚Äì 24.9
* **Overweight:** 25.0 ‚Äì 29.9
* **Obese:** >= 30.0
